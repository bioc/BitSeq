Title: Transcript expression inference and differential expression
        analysis for RNA-seq data

Description: The BitSeq package is targeted for transcript expression
        analysis and differential expression analysis of RNA-seq data
        in two stage process. In the first stage it uses Bayesian
        inference methodology to infer expression of individual
        transcripts from individual RNA-seq experiments. The second
        stage of BitSeq embraces the differential expression analysis
        of transcript expression. Providing expression estimates from
        replicates of multiple conditions, Log-Normal model of the
        estimates is used for inferring the condition mean transcript
        expression and ranking the transcripts based on the likelihood
        of differential expression.
